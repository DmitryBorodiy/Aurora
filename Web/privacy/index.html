                                Aurora collects data from users as they interact with them and our products. 
                                Users provide some of this data directly, and Aurora obtains some 
                                of it by collecting data about user interactions and their interactions with our products. 
                                What data we collect depends on the context of your interaction with the application, the choices you make, including your privacy settings, 
                                and the products and components you use.<br />

                                You can choose which technologies you want to use and what data you want to share. You may refuse a request to provide your personal information. 
                                Many of Aurora's features require certain personal information 
                                to function. If you choose not to provide information necessary 
                                for the operation of a product or feature, you may not be able to 
                                use that product or feature. Similarly, if we need to collect personal data to comply with legal requirements or 
                                to enter into a contract and you do not provide the data, we may not be able to enter into the contract. If this is related to a product you are already using, 
                                we will have to suspend or cancel its use. In this case, we will notify you. Although the provision of data is optional and you can choose not to share personal data, 
                                some features, such as personalization, that use such data will not be available to you.
